1. I expect to see the coefficient as around .3 and the intercept as around 1. This would demonstrate that the regression works because the line is approximating the data. 
2. I expect to see a best fit line, that cuts through the middle of the y values.
3. I could remove the noise from the equation, and then the numbers the regression outputs should be identical to the equation Jen put in. 
4. My guess still holds true with the 3D dataset, because the 3D dataset outputs two coeffecients because there are two different inputs for each y value.
